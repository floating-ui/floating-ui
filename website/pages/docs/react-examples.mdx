# React Examples

One of the goals of the library is to allow you to mix and match
your own logic with the library's. Ideally, you should be able to
create any type of component, including ones that may be missing
from standard component libraries.

It tries to be as extensible as possible without getting in your
way, providing helpers, especially for the hard parts like
accessibility. If it's missing a feature you need, you can add it
yourself without trouble.

<Notice>
  Interactions are only available for React DOM, not React
  Native.

## Full guides

Learn how to build these common floating UI components, complete
with a reusable component example. These components heavily
leverage the
[React Context API](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useContext)
to create "compound components", one of the best use cases for
using context.

## Other

Learn how to create other types of floating UI components by
reading a CodeSandbox demo. Note that these demos are far less
complete and may be a bit hard to understand without the full
guide, but you can tinker with them and see how things work.
