# useHover

Adds hover event listeners that change the open state, like CSS
`:hover{:.objectKey}`.

```js /useHover/
import {
  useFloating,
  useInteractions,
  useHover,
} from '@floating-ui/react-dom-interactions';

// ...
const {context} = useFloating();
const {getReferenceProps, getFloatingProps} = useInteractions([
  useHover(context, {
    // props
  }),
]);
```

## Props

```js
interface Props {
  enabled?: boolean;
  mouseOnly?: boolean;
  delay?: number | Partial<{open: number, close: number}>;
  restMs?: number;
  move?: boolean;
  handleClose?: null | HandleCloseFn;
}
```

### enabled

default: `true{:js}`

Conditionally enable/disable the hook.

```js
useHover(context, {
  enabled: false,
});
```

### mouseOnly

default: `false{:js}`

Whether the logic only runs for mouse input, ignoring both touch
and pen pointer inputs.

```js
useHover(context, {
  mouseOnly: true,
});
```

### delay

default: `0{:js}`

Waits for the specified time when the event listener runs before
changing the `open{:.const}` state.

```js
useHover(context, {
  // both open and close
  delay: 500,

  // configure them individually
  delay: {
    open: 500,
    close: 0,
  },
});
```

### restMs

default: `0{:js}` (off)

Waits until the user's cursor is at "rest" over the reference
element before changing the open state.

You can either:

- Use this on its own, without `delay{:.objectKey}` (which must
  be set to `0{:js}` which is the default), or
- Use this as a more eager version of `delay{:.objectKey}`, where
  `delay{:.objectKey}` will then act as a fallback value.

```js
useHover(context, {
  // Waits 150ms once the user's cursor is at rest
  restMs: 150,

  delay: {open: 1000}, // 1000ms fallback open value
  delay: 0, // OR no fallback value
});
```

### move

Whether moving the cursor over the floating element will open it,
without a regular hover event required.

For example, if it was resting over the reference element when it
closed. Uses the `'mousemove'{:js}` event.

```js
useHover(context, {
  move: false, // true by default
});
```

### handleClose

default: `null{:js}`

Instead of closing the floating element when the cursor leaves
its reference, we can leave it open until a certain condition is
satisfied.

The package exports a `safePolygon(){:js}` handler which will
only close the floating element if the pointer is outside a
dynamically computed polygon area.

This allows the user to move the cursor off the reference element
and towards the floating element without it closing (e.g. it has
interactive content inside).

```js
import {
  useHover,
  safePolygon,
} from '@floating-ui/react-dom-interactions';

// ...
useHover(context, {
  handleClose: safePolygon(),
});
```

This handler runs on `pointermove{:.string}`.

## safePolygon

A "safe" polygon is one that a pointer is safe to traverse as it
moves off the reference element and toward the floating element
after hovering it. If the pointer moves outside of this safe
area, the floating element closes.

It is a dynamic 4-sided polygon (visually a triangle) originating
from the cursor once it leaves a reference element.
[You can see what it looks like here](https://twitter.com/atomiksdev/status/1505076100854337539).

This function takes options.

### restMs

default: `0{:js}` (off)

Determines whether to close the floating once the cursor is at
rest for the specified number of milliseconds mid-traversal. The
default value (0) will never close it unless the pointer is
outside the area.

> **Note:** this applies only if the cursor is not close enough
> to the floating element to be within the `offset(){:js}`
> region, so it does not apply too eagerly.

```js
useHover(context, {
  handleClose: safePolygon({
    restMs: 50,
  }),
});
```

### buffer

default: `0.5{:js}`

Determines the amount of buffer (in pixels) there is around the
the polygon.

While the default value should handle the vast majority of cases
correctly, if you find your floating element is closing
unexpectedly as the pointer tries to move toward the floating
element, try increasing this value.

```js
useHover(context, {
  handleClose: safePolygon({
    buffer: 1,
  }),
});
```

### Blocking pointer-events

By default, the safe polygon blocks all CSS `pointer-events`
behind the polygon, reference, and floating elements. This is so
the user does not fire hover events over other elements
unintentionally while they traverse the polygon.

If your reference element is inside a scrollable container, this
means it cannot be scrolled while the cursor rests over the
reference element.

There is a workaround for disabling this `pointer-events`
behavior, but note, if there are items beneath the polygon with
hover events that can open other floating elements, this results
in poor UX.

```js
// Place this effect after `useInteractions()` in your component
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  if (open && refs.floating.current) {
    const doc = refs.floating.current.ownerDocument ?? document;
    doc.body.style.pointerEvents = '';
  }
}, [open]);
```

Another option is to add `pointer-events: auto{:sass}` to your
scrolling container, then add an inner `<div>{:html}` inside the
scrolling container that wraps all elements inside of it, and
copies the `<body>{:html}` `pointer-events` style using a
`MutationObserver{:.class}`.
