# Getting Started

Floating UI is a tiny, low-level library for creating "floating"
elements like tooltips, popovers, dropdowns, menus, and more.

The library provides two key functionalities:

### 1. Anchor positioning

Anchor a floating element (like a tooltip) to another element
(like a button) while simultaneously ensuring it stays in view as
best as possible with collision detection.

### 2. User interactions for React

Hooks and components for composing interactions to create
accessible floating UI components.

## Install

Floating UI is platform-agnostic and supports a variety of
platforms.

### Vanilla DOM positioning

Use on the web with vanilla JavaScript or a non-React framework
([view tutorial](/docs/tutorial)).

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/dom
```

<Notice>
  This library is how you use Floating UI with HTML/SVG elements
  (`dom` refers to the [Document Object
  Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)).
</Notice>

### React DOM positioning

Use with React DOM ([view docs](/docs/react-dom)).

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/react-dom
```

### React DOM interactions and positioning

Craft interactions in addition to anchor positioning
([view docs](/docs/react-dom-interactions)).

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/react-dom-interactions
```

### React Native positioning

Use with React Native ([view docs](/docs/react-native)).

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/react-native
```

### Canvas or other platforms

If you're targeting a platform other than the vanilla DOM (web),
React, or React Native, you can create your own
[Platform](/docs/platform).

This allows you to support things like Canvas/WebGL, or other
platforms that can run JavaScript.

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/core
```

## CDN

Floating UI can be loaded via CDN using ESM or UMD format.

### ESM

```js
import {computePosition} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__/+esm';
```

### UMD

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/core@__CORE_VERSION__"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__"></script>
```

All exports will be available on `window.FloatingUIDOM{:js}`.

## Package entry points

<Notice>
  Using webpack, Vite, or Parcel? Skip this section as modern
  bundlers handle this for you.
</Notice>

Floating UI uses `process.env.NODE_ENV{:js}` to determine whether
your build is in development or production mode. This allows us
to add console warnings and errors during development to help you
but ensure they get stripped out in production to keep the bundle
size small.

This causes an error in Rollup and low/no-build setups. To solve
this, Floating UI exports browser-ready ES modules. Leverage the
"browser" package export condition to use these modules.

<details>
  <summary>Rollup example</summary>

The `browser{:.objectKey}` option in the `nodeResolve(){:js}`
plugin will select browser versions of packages if available.

```js
import {nodeResolve} from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    nodeResolve({
      browser: true,

      // Add this line for development config, omit for
      // production config
      exportConditions: ['development'],
    }),
  ],
};
```

You may alternatively use the
[replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-replace)
plugin:

```js
export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    replace({
      'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production'),
    }),
  ],
};
```
