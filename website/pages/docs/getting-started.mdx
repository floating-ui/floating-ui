# Getting Started

Floating UI is a small library that helps you create "floating"
elements such as tooltips, popovers, dropdowns, and more.

It offers two main features:

1. **Anchor positioning**: Anchor a floating element (such as a
   tooltip) to another element (such as a button) while
   simultaneously ensuring it stays in view as best as possible
   by avoiding collisions. This feature is available for all
   platforms.
2. **User interactions for React**: Hooks and components for
   composing interactions to create accessible floating UI
   components.

## Why

Floating elements are absolutely positioned, typically anchored
to another UI element. Ensuring a floating element remains
anchored next to another element can be challenging, especially
in unique layout contexts like scrolling containers.

Absolute positioning can also cause problems when the floating
element is too close to the edge of the viewport and becomes
obscured, also known as a collision. When a collision occurs, the
position must be adjusted to ensure the floating element remains
visible.

Further, floating elements are often interactive, which can raise
complex accessibility issues when designing user interactions.

Floating UI offers a set of low-level features to help you
navigate these challenges and build accessible floating UI
components.

## Install

To install Floating UI, you can use a package manager like npm or
a CDN. There are different versions available for different
platforms.

### Vanilla

Use on the web with vanilla JavaScript.

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/dom
```

<Notice>
  `dom` refers to the [Document Object
  Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)
  to work with HTML/SVG elements.
</Notice>

You can either start by [reading the tutorial](/docs/tutorial),
which teaches you how to use the library by building a basic
tooltip, or you can jump right into the
[API documentation](/docs/computePosition).

### React

Use with [React DOM](/docs/react) or
[React Native](/docs/react-native).

#### React DOM

```shell
# Positioning + interactions
npm install @floating-ui/react

# Positioning only (smaller size)
npm install @floating-ui/react-dom
```

#### React Native

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/react-native
```

### Vue

Use with [Vue](/docs/vue).

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/vue
```

### Canvas or other platforms

If you're targeting a platform other than the vanilla DOM (web),
React, or React Native, you can create your own
[Platform](/docs/platform). This allows you to support things
like Canvas/WebGL, or other platforms that can run JavaScript.

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/core
```

## CDN

Floating UI can be loaded via CDN using ESM or UMD format.

### ESM

```js
import {computePosition} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__/+esm';
```

### UMD

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/core@__CORE_VERSION__"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__"></script>
```

All exports will be available on `window.FloatingUIDOM{:js}`.

## Package entry points

<Notice>
  Using webpack, Vite, or Parcel? Skip this section as modern
  bundlers handle this for you.
</Notice>

Floating UI uses `process.env.NODE_ENV{:js}` to determine whether
your build is in development or production mode. This allows us
to add console warnings and errors during development to help you
but ensure they get stripped out in production to keep the bundle
size small.

This causes an error in Rollup and low/no-build setups. To solve
this, Floating UI exports browser-ready ES modules. Leverage the
"browser" package export condition to use these modules.

<details>
  <summary>Rollup example</summary>

The `browser{:.objectKey}` option in the `nodeResolve(){:js}`
plugin will select browser versions of packages if available.

```js
import {nodeResolve} from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    nodeResolve({
      browser: true,

      // Add this line for development config, omit for
      // production config
      exportConditions: ['development'],
    }),
  ],
};
```

You may alternatively use the
[replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-replace)
plugin:

```js
export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    replace({
      'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production'),
    }),
  ],
};
```
