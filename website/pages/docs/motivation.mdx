# Motivation

So, why a new API? This page aims to explain why this new API was
created.

## Comparison with Popper-style API

[Popper](https://popper.js.org) is currently the most popular
open source solution to position floating elements, created
in 2016. Prior to that it was [Tether](https://tether.io/).

Floating UI is the evolution of Popper v2, with a more modern
API.  
It also aims to be more ambitious by offering higher-level
primitives, not just positioning logic, under the new package
identity (in the future).

The differences are summarized as follows:

- **Cross-platform**: Floating UI is cross-platform, while Popper
  not. This means it supports React Native and any other JS
  environment, not just the web.
- **Smaller size**: The code is smaller and more optimized, and
  everything is modular by default, and thus tree-shakeable.
  Popper is not tree-shakeable by default, and even when enabling
  the tree-shaking format it's not as effective. With Floating
  UI, you can even change the DOM platform to be smaller to save
  even more size if you don't need all advanced checks.
- **More intuitive API**: Popper's API is highly mutable, which
  can be hard to debug. Floating UI is pure with more intuitive
  naming of various APIs. Modifying options of middleware (or
  modifiers in Popper) takes far fewer characters to write.
- **Inversion of control**: There were many issues opened
  surrounding the nature of `computeStyles` and `applyStyles` in
  Popper. Leaving the application of styles up to you means you
  don't get annoyed when the library is doing something with the
  styles you don't want to happen. Use the computed data as you
  please.
- **Improved extensibility**: Modifiers in Popper are hard to
  write. `requires`, `requiresIfExists`, `phase`, needing to
  check for other modifiers' data to correctly position
  something, etc. Floating UI removes all of it. It's all based
  on the order of the array, and that's up to you.
- **More features**: New features are easier to support thanks to
  the new architecture, and Floating UI already offers more, like
  the `size{:.function}` middleware. Importantly, new features
  are tree-shaken away even if you don't use them, so there's no
  size cost.
- **More predictable**: Floating UI doesn't perform any "magic",
  like adding event listeners to update the position, or
  auto-ordering the modifiers array. This means you use Floating
  UI starting at its most fundamental level, without any
  middleware enabled already. You add features as you need them,
  which makes the library more predictable.

Floating UI aims to be an ideal solution for component libraries,
like Bootstrap or Material UI, due to its low-level and
unopinionated nature.
