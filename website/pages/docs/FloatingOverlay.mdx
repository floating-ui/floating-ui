# FloatingOverlay

Provides base styling for a fixed overlay element to dim content
or block pointer events behind a floating element.

It's a regular `<div />{:js}`, so it can be styled via any CSS
solution you prefer.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
import {FloatingOverlay} from '@floating-ui/react-dom-interactions';

// ...
<FloatingOverlay>
  <Dialog>
    <button>Open</button>
  </Dialog>
</FloatingOverlay>
```

## Props

```js
interface Props {
  lockScroll?: boolean;
}
```

### lockScroll

Whether the `<body>{:html}` is prevented from scrolling while the
overlay is rendered. Uses a robust technique that works on iOS
and handles horizontal scrolling.

If you need a more advanced solution, or find enabling this prop
causes unwanted side effects in your application,
[react-remove-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-remove-scroll)
is a solid solution.
