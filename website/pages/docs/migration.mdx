# Migration

Learn how to migrate from Popper v2 to Floating UI.

</PageCard>

**Rebranding**: The library was rebranded as it offers more
packages and functionality, like the new [React](/docs/react)
package that provides interactions, while Popper only ever
offered positioning.

**New API**: The goal of the new API was to make Floating UI
lower-level and act more like CSS in which you progressively add
properties to achieve the desired positioning behavior, without
pre-configuring anything.

In addition, we wanted to make the configuration more ergonomic,
the library smaller and fully tree-shakeable (so new features
don't bloat bundles if unused), and also wanted to support React
Native/Canvas as they had been requested, which is now supported.

**Different, but familiar**: Floating UI forked Popper 2 and
shares a lot of similarities. While the main external positioning
function changed, many other parts of the API are similar.

Similarities include:

- The order of arguments and types of the positioning function
  are practically identical.
- `placement{:.key}` and `strategy{:.key}` are the same, passed
  as a third argument options object.
- `middleware{:.key}` in Floating UI is conceptually similar to
  `modifiers{:.key}` from Popper 2.
- Options passed to middleware have very similar configuration as
  Popper 2, and APIs like `detectOverflow` and virtual elements
  are almost identical.

## Change dependencies

First thing's first, uninstall `@popperjs/core` and install
`@floating-ui/dom`.

```diff
npm uninstall @popperjs/core
npm install @floating-ui/dom
```

## Positioning function change

Popper applied styles and added modifiers for you by default.
Floating UI on the other hand is completely bare bones â€” you add
what you need with nothing pre-configured.

In Popper, you called `createPopper(){:js}` like so and it would
place the popper element at the bottom for you automatically.

```js
import {createPopper} from '@popperjs/core';

createPopper(reference, popper);
```

Floating UI does not apply styles or add modifiers (now more
generically called middleware) for you. Instead it's pure and
only returns data that you can use as you please.

Set up the [initial styles](/docs/computePosition#initial-layout)
on the floating element in your CSS:

```css
.floating {
  width: max-content;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

Then, apply the coordinates using the positioning data resolved
by the function:

```js
import {computePosition} from '@floating-ui/dom';

computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl).then(({x, y}) => {
  Object.assign(floatingEl.style, {
    left: `${x}px`,
    top: `${y}px`,
  });
});
```

Read more about [`computePosition` here](/docs/computePosition).

## Updating the position automatically

`computePosition(){:js}` is not stateful, it only positions your
element once.

Popper added listeners automatically to update the position on
scroll and resize. In Floating UI, you add this yourself, and
it's much more explicit that it needs to be cleaned up:

```js
import {computePosition, autoUpdate} from '@floating-ui/dom';

// When the floating element is open on the screen
const cleanup = autoUpdate(referenceEl, floatingEl, () => {
  computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl).then(({x, y}) => {
    Object.assign(floatingEl.style, {
      left: `${x}px`,
      top: `${y}px`,
    });
  });
});

// When the floating element is removed from the screen
cleanup();
```

Floating UI also adds `ResizeObserver{:.class}` listeners by
default, unlike Popper, handling an additional update edge case.

Read more about [`autoUpdate` here](/docs/autoUpdate).

## Configure middleware

Floating UI honors the `placement{:.key}` you passed in and does
not modify it by default:

```js
import {computePosition} from '@floating-ui/dom';

computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  side: 'top',
}).then(({x, y}) => {
  // ...
});
```

Even if the floating element will overflow the top of the screen,
it will still be placed and anchored there.

If you'd like to directly match Popper's default behavior to
prevent collisions, add in `flip(){:js}`, `shift(){:js}` and
`limitShift(){:js}` in the following order:

```js
import {
  computePosition,
  flip,
  shift,
  limitShift,
} from '@floating-ui/dom';

computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  side: 'top',
  middleware: [flip(), shift({limiter: limitShift()})],
}).then(({x, y}) => {
  // ...
});
```

Unlike Popper 2, the **order of the array matters** and is not
adjusted for you. The [Middleware](/docs/middleware) page
explains the concept in detail. Essentially, if you place one of
the middleware before or after another, the positioning result
can change. This helps enable full control as sometimes you want
different behavior based on the ordering.

The `preventOverflow` modifier from Popper is now called `shift`.
This is because technically many modifiers in Popper 2 "prevented
overflow", which does not describe what it is actually doing
unlike `shift`.

You'll hopefully notice the API is much more ergonomic at the
point of the function call.

Popper 2:

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'offset',
      options: {
        offset: [0, 10],
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Floating UI:

```js
computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  middleware: [offset(10)],
});
```

- [`offset`](/docs/offset)

A lot of the options passed in to middleware options are similar
or the same as Popper 2. To learn about their options, you can
read their pages on the sidebar on the left.

## Arrows styling

In Popper you could add a `data-popper-arrow{:.keyword}` element
inside your popper and it'd automatically be picked up and
styled.

As Floating UI is pure, you now handle these styles yourself, and
you always pass an element in manually. You can read more about
this on the [`arrow` middleware](/docs/arrow) page.

## Auto placement is now a middleware

In Popper 2, this was part of `flip` but now it's separate and is
no longer a string option for `placement{:.key}`.

Popper 2:

```js
import {createPopper} from '@popperjs/core';

createPopper(reference, popper, {
  placement: 'auto',
});
```

Floating UI:

```js
import {computePosition, autoPlacement} from '@floating-ui/dom';

computePosition(referenceEl, floatingEl, {
  middleware: [autoPlacement()],
});
```

## Other

APIs like [`detectOverflow`](/docs/detectOverflow) and
[virtual elements](/docs/virtual-elements) are basically the same
as Popper 2 with only minor differences.

`detectOverflow(){:js}` must now be called with the
`await{:.keyword}` keyword before it but accepts the same options
as Popper 2 with minor differences.
