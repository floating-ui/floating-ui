Like the technical community as a whole, the Floating UI team and community is
made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world,
working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching and
connecting people.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
people to adhere to when they're participating within this community and
project. These rules apply equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help
and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Floating UI project:
this includes GitHub, and Twitter.

- **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users and
  colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
  decisions.
- **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel
  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Floating
  UI community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as
  with people outside the Floating UI community and with user
  groups/conferences, usergroup/conference organizers.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Remember that sexist, racist, and
  other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Be kind to
  others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Behave professionally.
  Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not
  appropriate for the community.
- **When we disagree, we try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time and Floating UI is no exception. It is
  important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
  Remember that we're different. The strength of Floating UI comes from its
  varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people
  have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone
  holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is
  human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to
  help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.
